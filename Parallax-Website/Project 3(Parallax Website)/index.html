        in the least developed countries. This rapid technological change is
        affecting almost every area of the economy, society and culture. Rapid
        technological change involves, among others, technologies like big data,
        the Internet of things, machine learning, artificial intelligence,
        robotics, 3D printing, biotechnology, nanotechnology, renewable energy
        technologies, and satellite and drone technologies.Technology would be
        an body of knowledge for which would devoted to creating tools,
        processing actions and extracting of materials. The term ‘Technology” is
        wide and everyone has their own way of understanding the meaning of
        technology. We use technology to accomplish various tasks in our daily
        lives and We can describe technology as products, processes or

        problem.We use technology at work, we use it to , extract materials. We
        use technology in the communication, transportation, learning,
        manufacturing, creating artifacts, securing data, scaling businesses.
        Technology is human knowledge which involves tools, materials and
        systems. The application of technology results in arti-facts or
